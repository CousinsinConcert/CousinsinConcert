                <h1>Srikar Vaasan</h1>
                <h4>Violinist, Pianist, Carnatic Flautist, Carnatic Vocalist</h4>

                <h1>Maithreyi Narakesari</h1>
                <h4>Carnatic Vocalist</h4>
                <p>Maithreyi’s early induction into 
                    the world of Carnatic happened 
                    with her parents at the age of 2,
                     when she started singing snippets 
                     of Carnatic music and was able to 
                     distinguish between 5 ragas by the 
                     age of 4. This early exposure into 
                     the rich melodies of Carnatic music 
                     laid a strong foundation for her future
                    musical endeavors. The subsequent 
                    primary stint in Isha Home School 
                    opened up further opportunities for 
                    her to learn other flavors of Indian 
                    music, including North Indian abhangs 
                    and songs in a variety of other languages.
                    She was fortunate to get an opportunity to
                    perform in 2014 at the Mahashivaratri 
                    program in front of a live international 
                    audience of 75000+ people. Parallel to her
                    musical pursuits, Maithreyi also delved 
                    into the realm of Bharatanatyam, a 
                    classical Indian dance form. In the 
                    following five years, she completed 
                    the Karnataka junior board exam for both
                    music and dance. With her recent transition
                    to Atlanta, Maithreyi has embarked on a new 
                    chapter in her musical journey. She has humbly 
                    begun to explore the fascinating parallels 
                    between Carnatic and western classical music, 
                    seeking to find links between the two.</p>

                <h1>Jithanth Vainatheya</h1>
                <h4>Pianist</h4>
                <p>Jithanth's musical journey began in The Hague, Netherlands, where he had singing and recorder lessons. In the United Kingdom, at the age of 5, he had his first piano lesson in a church group. The experience introduced him to reading, writing, and playing music, and the enchanting sound of the Organ left a lasting impact. It was during this time that Jithanth discovered the music of Beethoven, which ignited his love for Western Classical Music, a passion that never left him. <br><br>
                    ​
                    Upon returning to India, Jithanth faced limited musical opportunities at school, but he continued his lessons until the pandemic disrupted them. Despite a waning interest in piano, Jithanth found renewed motivation in the freedom from strict curricula. He focused on learning the pieces that resonated with him and delved into the expressive and narrative aspects of music. He also took every opportunity he could get to perform at school or elsewhere.<br><br>
                    ​
                    Inspired by his shared love for Classic Rock with friends, Jithanth formed a band and embarked on a musical journey. Together, they organized a music festival at school, aiming to foster a love for all genres of music. Throughout this journey, the music of Beethoven remained a profound influence on Jithanth, solidifying his admiration for not only western classical music but music as a whole.<br><br>
                     
                    Recently, Jithanth has reignited his passion for music and resumed lessons with newfound vigor and enthusiasm. This revival of his musical pursuits is a testament to his unwavering love for the craft. Jithanth's journey continues to evolve, paving the way for further exploration and growth as he seeks to fulfill his artistic aspirations.</p>
